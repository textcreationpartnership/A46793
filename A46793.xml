            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <salute>Mr. Common Sergeant,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IT ſeems a vain thing for this Court to be ſerious about the Choice of Magiſtrates and Officers for the well Government of the City, except they firſt take care to remedy thoſe many Miſchiefs and Grievances, which the City now groans under, and which ſeem to threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the ruine and deſtruction of the whole, that if there be not ſome ſpeedy redreſs, there will be little need of Magiſtrates and Officers; for there will be no City or People left here to be Governed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>London</hi> has once already been burned to aſhes, and firing is now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſuch a Trade, that not only <hi>London,</hi> the Burrough of <hi>Southwark,</hi> and the places adjoyning, but all the Cities, Burroughs, Towns Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, and places of principal Trade throughout the whole Kingdom, are perpetually in danger; ſo that no rational or conſiderate man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us can promiſe himſelf, his Wife, his Children, or Eſtate one nights ſecurity, but they may all be devoured in the conſuming flames, except ſome ſpeedy and effectual courſe be taken.</p>
            <p>But this is not all; For were our Houſes ſecure from fire, yet ſuch is the general decay of Trade, as if not remedied, muſt unavoidably bring the whole City to poverty and ruine; and it is conceived, that this is very much occaſioned by the <hi>French,</hi> who have laid ſuch great Impoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions upon our Woollen Cloth, Stuffs, and other Manufactures, that we have almoſt loſt our Trade with <hi>France;</hi> they have ſpoild our Trade with <hi>Holland, Flanders</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi> by a deſtructive War; they have ruined our Trade at home, and beggared many thouſands of our honeſt and induſtrious Weavers, and other <hi>Engliſh</hi> Manufactors and Traders, by the vaſt quantity of their Silks, and other unneceſſary Commodities import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed hither: ſo that upon an exact ballance of the Trade between us and them taken, it has been demonſtrated, that this City and Kingdom
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:63592:2"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 103 -->doth loſe <hi>Eleven hundred thouſand pounds</hi> every year. By means whereof, they who in Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> time might not be ſuffered to build Men of War are now grown ſo powerful at Sea, as to be able to beat both <hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>Spaniard,</hi> and have made themſelves in a manner ſole Maſters of the <hi>Mediterranean</hi> Sea: And they are grown ſo preſumptuous as daily to injure and affront our <hi>Engliſh Merchants,</hi> and ſometimes in his Majeſties own Ports. Their Privateers daily take our Merchants Ships, plunder others, ſtrip, impriſon and torment our Seamen to the great diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement of our <hi>Engliſh Navigation,</hi> and almoſt ruine of the Merchant.</p>
            <p>I ſhall inſtance but in one thing more, but that is worſe than all the reſt, <hi>That is the juſt appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion that is upon the minds of good men of danger to his Majeſties Perſon and the Proteſtant Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I had not ſpoken this at this time and place, but having the honour to ſerve this City in Common Council, I have endeavoured at ſeveral times to bring theſe things before that Court, but could not. In the end of the laſt Common-Council I did deſire my Lord Mayor that a Common-Council might ſpeedily be held to hear and conſider of a Petition about trade, ſubſcribed by a great number of Citizens of good quality, and his Lordſhip did then promiſe that a Common-Council ſhould ſpeedily be held; But it is a good time ſince, and there have been many Fires and Loſſes, but no Common-Council. Wherefore me-thinks it doth become the wiſdom and gravity of this Court not to admit of any longer delay in a matter wherein their <hi>All</hi> is concern'd. And I do humbly move (and I conceive it is not only my ſenſe but the ſenſe of the far greater part of this Court) that ſome Members of this Court may accompany the Sheriffs and Mr. Common Sergeant before we proceed to any other matter, to wait upon my Lord Mayor, and the Court of Aldermen, to deſire that a Common-Council might ſpeedily be held, humbly to Petition His Majeſty, That for the quieting and ſatisfying the minds of his liege People, and for remedy of the many miſchiefs and grievances we now groan under, He would gratiouſly be pleaſed (according to the Statutes of 4th. and 36th. of <hi>Edvv.</hi> 3.) immediately to call a <hi>New Parliament.</hi>
